Requirments for this coding exercise:

Create your most user­friendly form using HTML and Javascript that allows a user to input a US street address.
Requirements

1. The form should accept house number, street, city, state and zip code. Optionally, the form should
accept a unit number. Your current home address is a great example of a potential input (but make sure
to test with a variety).

2. Make sure the form functions properly on all major desktop browsers (tell us what minimum version of
IE you’re choosing to support)

3. Provide some basic level of validation with user­friendly error messages
Optional

4. Use core JQuery library

5. Use Google Maps (or any 3rd party service) to assist with validation & feedback
Beware

6. Don’t use any Javascript plugins outside of core JQuery

7. Don’t copy someone else’s solution... we’re good at googling and searching Github too.
Bonus Points

8. Make sure the form works properly on tablets and phones (if you end up supporting specific devices or
operating systems, just let us know which ones)

9. Make your code beautiful... we love developers who obsess over clarity and consistency.


Additional Usability Features:

1. The address entered is checked against previous entries to prevent duplication.

2. Addresses that have been validated are displayed below the form.

3. The user is notified when an address has been added or if an address is a duplicate.

4. White space is trimmed from inputs that the user may not have noticed.

5. To prevent double submissions, the submit button is disabled while validation is being done.

6. For a cleaner look, placeholder text was used and the labels hidden. The labels only appear for older versions of IE that do not support placeholder text.

7. The form was built with Responsive Web Design techniques so it would look as good as possible at different browser sizes.
